# üì∏ Product Photoshoot Engine - AI-Driven Product Imagery

The **Product Photoshoot Engine** is a cost-effective, AI-powered solution for generating high-quality product images against various backgrounds. Built using Stable Diffusion through Automatic 1111, this project allows e-commerce businesses to create stunning visuals for products, enhancing customer engagement while significantly reducing traditional photoshoot costs.

## üåü Features
- **Dynamic Backgrounds**: Automatically generates product images with diverse backgrounds such as sand, snow, forest, and water.
- **Cost-Effective**: Eliminates the need for expensive product photoshoots, reducing costs by up to 50%.
- **Engagement Boost**: Enhances customer engagement by providing visually appealing product imagery.
- **Scalable**: Capable of handling large volumes of product images, making it suitable for businesses of all sizes.

## üöÄ Tech Stack
- **Stable Diffusion**: Used for generating high-quality, realistic product images.
- **Automatic 1111**: Interface for managing the image generation workflow.
- **Python**: Core programming language for implementing the engine and automating the workflow.
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: Used for experimentation, data preprocessing, and model fine-tuning.

## üß† How It Works
- **Data Input**: The engine takes input images of products (e.g., bottles, shoes) in a plain background.
- **Image Generation**: Uses Stable Diffusion to place the product in various simulated environments like snow, sand, forest, or water.
- **Customization**: Provides options to modify settings such as lighting, angles, and background types for more versatile outputs.

## üìù Project Structure
Here's a breakdown of the key components of this project:

- `src/`: Main code files and scripts for the image generation engine.
- `assets/`: Contains sample input images and background assets.
- `models/`: Includes the pre-trained Stable Diffusion model or links for downloading it.
- `results/`: Stores generated product images with different backgrounds.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter Notebooks for model fine-tuning, testing, and experimentation.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists the Python dependencies for this project.

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- [Automatic 1111](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui)
- [Stable Diffusion](https://stability.ai/)

### Installation
1. **Clone this repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/product-photoshoot-engine.git
    cd product-photoshoot-engine
    ```

2. **Install the required packages:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Set up Stable Diffusion:**
   Follow the instructions in the [Automatic 1111 repository](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui) to set up the Stable Diffusion environment.

### Usage
1. **Prepare Input Images:**
   - Place the product images in the `assets/input/` directory.

2. **Run the Engine:**
    ```bash
    python src/run_engine.py
    ```

3. **View Results:**
   - Generated product images will be saved in the `results/` directory.
